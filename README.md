The Birthday Paradox:

Imagine a group of people in a room.

What’s the probability that at least two people share the same birthday?

Surprisingly, once you have 23 people, the probability is already greater than 50%.

This seems counter-intuitive, which is why it’s called a "paradox."# BirthdayParadox---Lab-9
